From the beginning of the experience, to the product in hand... Everything was so easy and accommodating.  Jo worked so hard to get everything just right and to make the " save the dates" absolutely perfect.  If I couldn't think of a color scheme, she did. If I changed my mind on the picture we wanted to use, she didn't blink an eye. If I wanted the wording differently, she changed it. She offered suggestions and gave her professional opinion when I needed it, yet let me have my own creative approach. I would highly recommend her company to anyone wanting not only the best product but the best care and communication through the whole process.”</em></div>
